*This project focuses on generating a structured PDF report using Python. The main objective was to read data from a text file, process it, and convert it into a well-formatted PDF document.
I started by creating a simple data file (data.txt) that contains sample content. Then, using Python, I wrote a script that reads the content from the file and formats it properly. The report generation was done using the ReportLab library, which helps in creating PDFs programmatically.
During the implementation, I also handled common errors such as missing modules and file reading issues. The script ensures that the content is correctly displayed in the PDF format without any data loss.
This project helped me understand file handling, error handling, and working with external libraries in Python. It also improved my problem-solving skills while debugging issues like module installation and undefined variables.
Overall, this project demonstrates how Python can be used for automation and report generation in real-world applications*
